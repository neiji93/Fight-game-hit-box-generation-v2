# Fight-game-hit-box-generation-v2
Unusual and unnecessary source code to create hit/hurt boxes for a fighting game. It use radiosity to catch 3D rendered datas. It is non convenient and hardly
acceptable but I did it with freelancers. I mean the specs and full algorithm. It can catch some things !
